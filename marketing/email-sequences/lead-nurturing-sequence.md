Over the past 15 years and 2,500+ installations, we've heard every solar question imaginable. Here are the top concerns from Stone Mountain homeowners:

**"My roof isn't perfect south-facing"**
‚úÖ **Reality**: East and west-facing roofs work great too! We've installed successful systems on all roof orientations.

**"Is my roof strong enough?"**
‚úÖ **Reality**: Most Stone Mountain homes built after 1990 easily support solar. We perform structural assessments during consultation.

### Email 2: Addressing Common Hesitations (Day 4)
**Subject**: "Second thoughts about solar? Let's talk it through üí≠"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

After solar consultations, many Stone Mountain homeowners tell me they're thinking things like:

- "Is this really the right time?"
- "Should we wait for better technology?"
- "What if we move in a few years?"
- "Can we really trust these savings projections?"

**These are smart questions!** Let me address each one:

**‚è∞ "Is this the right time?"**
With 30% federal credits and Georgia incentives, timing is actually perfect. These incentives have expiration dates.

**üî¨ "Should we wait for technology improvements?"**  
Today's solar panels are already 22%+ efficient with 25-year warranties. Waiting costs you money in continued high electric bills.

**üè† "What if we move?"**
Solar increases home value by $20,000+ and makes homes sell 20% faster. It's a win whether you stay or go.

**üìä "Can we trust the savings projections?"**
Our projections are based on your actual usage and local utility rates. We guarantee system performance for 25 years.

**Still feeling uncertain?** That's normal for a significant investment. 

Here's what I'd like to offer:
- 15-minute phone call to address YOUR specific concerns
- References from 3 Stone Mountain customers
- Extended proposal validity (normally 30 days, I'll make yours 60 days)

[SCHEDULE 15-MIN CALL ‚Üí] or just reply with your biggest concern.

Remember: Every month you wait costs you about $[Monthly Savings] in continued high electric bills.

Best,
[Consultant Name]

### Email 5: Final Follow-Up (Day 14)
**Subject**: "Checking in on your solar decision ü§ù"

**Content**:
```
Hi [First Name],

It's been two weeks since we discussed solar for your Stone Mountain home, and I wanted to check in personally.

**Where things stand:**
- Your proposal is valid through [Date]
- Spring installation bonus available until March 31st
- Your monthly electric bills continue at $[Amount]
- You've spent approximately $[2 weeks of bills] on electricity since our meeting

**I'm wondering:**
- Did you have a chance to review the proposal with your family?
- Are there specific concerns I can help address?
- Would you like to schedule a brief follow-up call?
- Or are you ready to move forward with installation?

**No pressure from me** - I believe in educating, not pushing. Solar is a significant decision that should be made at your own pace.

**However, I want to share this perspective:**
In my 8 years helping Stone Mountain families go solar, I've never had a customer regret their decision. I have had customers tell me they wished they'd acted sooner.

**Three simple options:**
1. **Ready to proceed**: [ACCEPT PROPOSAL ‚Üí]
2. **Need more time**: Reply with "follow up in 30 days"  
3. **Have questions**: Call me at (404) 551-6532

**If I don't hear from you**, I'll assume you've decided solar isn't right for your family right now, and I won't continue following up. I respect your time and decision.

**If solar IS right for you**, I'd be honored to help your family achieve energy independence and start saving money immediately.

Thanks for considering EkoSolarPros for your solar needs.

Best regards,
